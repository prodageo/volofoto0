## Jekyll & Webpack, integrated

So you can have your React and serve it statically, too. Plugin-free! (<- that's like saying orange juice is gluten-free, btw)

Are you working with Github pages? See the gh-pages branch:

- https://github.com/allizad/jekyll-webpack/tree/gh-pages

You can learn more about how this was put together in my walkthrough post here:
- [Using Webpack and React withÂ Jekyll](https://medium.com/@allizadrozny/using-webpack-and-react-with-jekyll-cfe137f8a2cc)

See the full series of adding search to Jekyll, for which this project was a building block, here:

Woohoo! Now go build shit!
